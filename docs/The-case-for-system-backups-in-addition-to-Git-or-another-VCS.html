  <h2>The Case For System Backups In Addition To Git Or Another Vcs</h2>
  <time datetime="2018-02-24T00:00:00-05:00" class="by-line">24 Feb 2018</time>
  <p>As a former IT professional, the mantra of backups has been drilled into me. I feel that my fellow software engineers can fall into a false sense of security because we are trained to use a version control system (VCS) like git as part of our development workflow.</p>

<p>Backups are needed in addition to source code control because there are many things that are not in our source code. Here are a few things that are important enough to ensure that we do backups, this is by no means an exhaustive list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SSH Keys</li>
  <li>System Aliases</li>
  <li>Environment variables</li>
  <li>Code secrets (For example, API keys. These are often stored in a config file outside of Git control, or even within a system environment variable)</li>
  <li>Software configurations (like your text editor)</li>
  <li>Local git repositories that are not synced</li>
  <li>Small scratch projects we do when learning a new api. We often refer to these but don’t put them under source control</li>
  <li>Internet bookmarks</li>
  <li>Linter setup</li>
</ul>

<p>We developers are often doing rapid work day in day out. This may mean that on some days we make no system changes, on other days we make a lot of changes as we put new tools/techniques into place. I highly recommend backups following the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3–2–1</a> rule. Click the link for more details, but here is a quick run-down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 copies of your data (including the original)</li>
  <li>2 different mediums/devices containing your data</li>
  <li>1 copy off-site (what if you have a physical disaster?)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is my setup, and my justification for my setup.</p>

<p>To achieve my 3–2–1 goal, I’ve enlisted two tools. For my local system backup, I’m using Apple OS X’s built-in backup tool, Time Machine. I have my Time Machine configured to backup wirelessly to a networked drive. I took this approach because I didn’t wanted to be rooted in location within my home while backing up. Additionally, I don’t trust myself to regularly plug in my external hard drive. Time Machine gives me the benefits of a complete system restore along with file versioning. With this setup alone I have achieved the 2 different mediums rule, but I am still failing the 1 copy off site &amp; 3 copies of your data.</p>

<p>To achieve the complete rules, I enlisted a cloud backup solution, <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html">Backblaze</a> (if you want a free month, <a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/01nxgp">click here</a>, we’ll both get a free month). I chose Backblaze for several reasons. First is their flat rate of $50 a year per computer regardless of the data size. Backups can be set to be continuous rather than on a schedule. This means that rather than a set frequency (like time machine of every hour at its default) it will attempt to backup a file every time it changes, as soon as it changes, as long as you’ve access to the backblaze website. This is fantastic, I can have more confidence that my data is being backed up all-the-time, as long as I have internet access. With that, I’ve achieved my goal of 3–2–1. Additionally, backblaze will give me 30 days of file changes, or versions. This is great, should I need it.</p>

<p>The negative of Backblaze? It is not a system-level backup, I cannot do a full restore, but it is better than nothing. The initial backup can take a day or two. Applications will not be backed up, but you can install it again.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that file syncing tools such as dropbox and google drive are not backups. If you make a change or mess up a file, the changes will be synced across all your devices. This is important to note because of issues like ransomware. You want backups to be read-only unless you are explicitly recovering a file.</p>

<p>I hope you found this helpful in your day-to-day coding.</p>
